**Status label cheat sheet:**

   `playable` - Boots and plays without any crashes or gpu bugs of any kind, and at a speed fast enough to reasonably enjoy on your Deck.

   `ingame` - Boots and goes in-game but suffers from one or more of the following: crashes, deadlocks, gpu bugs, distractingly bad audio, or is simply too slow. Game still might able to be played all the way through, but not as the game is intended to play.

   `menus` - Boots and goes past the title screen but does not make it into main gameplay.

   `boots` - Boots but does not make it past the title screen.

   `nothing` - Does not boot/shows no signs of life.
